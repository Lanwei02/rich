On Wednesday (8/8/2018), I'll be presenting at APRA's Data Analytics Symposium. My talk is focused on using `leaflet` to make our fundraising work more efficient. Here is the session description: 

> Much of our work is location specificâ€”portfolio development, event planning, trip planning, etc. Therefore, to optimize our fundraising organizations, we must understand the geographic distribution of our alumni. This presentation will demonstrate how prospect researchers can create interactive maps using R and the javascript library leaflet. The presentation will include a brief introduction to R and html widgets as well as multiple demos, including how to programmatically create customized maps for each gift officer and how to add a layer to your maps that highlights the 100 zip codes with the highest mean income in United States.

My slides are below and the full deck is available [here](https://slides.com/richmajerus/apra2018) and the code is on [github](https://github.com/majerus/NEDRA2018).
